# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~
# 
# disallow local configuration files and backup files
Tenant/Include/Configuration.*
Manager/Include/Configuration.*
Common/Include/Configuration.*
# but include the configuration template files
!Tenant/Include/Configuration.inc.php.template
!Manager/Include/Configuration.inc.php.template
!Common/Include/Configuration.inc.php.template
# disallow all resource bundles (which could contain proprietary content)
Tenant/Resources/*
# but allow common resource files that ship with PhoenixSNS
!Tenant/Resources/Common
# as well as a readme file that describes how to use resource bundles
!Tenant/Resources/Readme.txt
# and don't pull in sandbox stuff (which is really only for testing locally)
Sandbox/*
# also ignore test PHP which is sometimes used to ... well, test stuff
test.php

# ignore Eclipse IDE stuff
